                  boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally
                  televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must

          <p>
            In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has
            emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era.
            As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African
            American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming
            and inclusive White House in history.<br /><br />
            While also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and
            girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the
            ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and
            standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most
            harrowing moments. <br /><br />Along the way, she showed us a few
            dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth
            daughters under an unforgiving media glare
